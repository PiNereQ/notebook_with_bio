# notebook_with_bio

Hey all! That's my first "real" commit, on my journey with using github. 
This project is set up only for android systems (for now).
It's a safe notebook, which's going to be secured by biometrics or also a password.
Maybe in the future I will learn some UX/UI here, maybe I should use the bloc here, but it's not that huge of a project to use it here imo.
I hope this first commit will start something huge, in advance it will not I'm keeping a message for me here, so I'd actually make some more coding here.
Enjoy your notebook ;).
